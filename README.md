## Overview

Introducing **the Wild Oasis** Hotel Management App: a sophisticated React web application tailored for hotel staff.

Powered by **Supabase** on the backend and **React Query** for remote state management, this feature-rich platform empowers employees to seamlessly oversee cabins, bookings, and guest management.

**Styled Components** ensure a sleek and responsive design, while **Rechart**s display insightful charts for sales and bookings. With **React Hot Toast** for intuitive message display, **React Router** for seamless navigation, and **React Hook Form** for efficient form handling, the user experience is both streamlined and intuitive.

The admin dashboard boasts dynamic **dark** and **ligh**t modes, catering to user preferences. Hotel employees can effortlessly view, filter, and sort cabins and bookings by various parameters, with pagination for enhanced organization.

Beyond basic management tasks, users can delve into advanced functionalities such as cabin customization, guest check-in/out, payment confirmation, and hotel settings adjustment. The dashboard also provides comprehensive statistics on total bookings, cabins, guests, and sales, with flexible duration toggling for insightful analysis.
